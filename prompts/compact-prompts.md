# Claude Code 压缩提示词 (Compact Prompts)

> 当对话接近上下文窗口限制时，Claude Code 会自动触发压缩流程。系统使用一个独立的 LLM 调用来将已有对话总结为结构化摘要，从而释放上下文空间。以下是压缩流程中使用的所有提示词。

---

## 1. 工具禁用前言 (No-Tools Preamble)

> 注：强制分类器只输出纯文本，不调用任何工具。这段文本会被放在压缩提示词的最前面。

```text
CRITICAL: Respond with TEXT ONLY. Do NOT call any tools.

- Do NOT use Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, Edit, Write, or ANY other tool.
- You already have all the context you need in the conversation above.
- Tool calls will be REJECTED and will waste your only turn -- you will fail the task.
- Your entire response must be plain text: an <analysis> block followed by a <summary> block.
```

---

## 2. 详细分析指令 - 全量压缩版 (Detailed Analysis Instruction - Base)

> 注：指导模型在生成摘要前先进行结构化分析，适用于全量压缩（对整个对话进行总结）。

```text
Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like:
     - file names
     - full code snippets
     - function signatures
     - file edits
   - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
   - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.
```

## 3. 详细分析指令 - 部分压缩版 (Detailed Analysis Instruction - Partial)

> 注：适用于部分压缩（只总结最近的消息，保留早期上下文）。

```text
Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Analyze the recent messages chronologically. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like:
     - file names
     - full code snippets
     - function signatures
     - file edits
   - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
   - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.

## 4. 全量压缩提示词 (Base Compact Prompt)

> 注：对整个对话进行总结时使用的主提示词。

```text
Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

${DETAILED_ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTION_BASE}

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
9. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.
                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]
</analysis>

<summary>

## 5. 部分压缩提示词 - "from" 方向 (Partial Compact Prompt)

> 注：只总结最近部分的消息，早期上下文保持不变。

```text
Your task is to create a detailed summary of the RECENT portion of the conversation -- the messages that follow earlier retained context. The earlier messages are being kept intact and do NOT need to be summarized. Focus your summary on what was discussed, learned, and accomplished in the recent messages only.

${DETAILED_ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTION_PARTIAL}

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture the user's explicit requests and intents from the recent messages

## 6. 部分压缩提示词 - "up_to" 方向 (Partial Compact Up-To Prompt)

> 注：总结前半部分对话，摘要会被放在继续会话的开头，后续更新的消息会紧跟其后。

```text
Your task is to create a detailed summary of this conversation. This summary will be placed at the start of a continuing session; newer messages that build on this context will follow after your summary (you do not see them here). Summarize thoroughly so that someone reading only your summary and then the newer messages can fully understand what happened and continue the work.

${DETAILED_ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTION_BASE}

6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks.
8. Work Completed: Describe what was accomplished by the end of this portion.
9. Context for Continuing Work: Summarize any context, decisions, or state that would be needed to understand and continue the work in subsequent messages.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]
</analysis>

<summary>
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   [Detailed description]

2. Key Technical Concepts:

## 7. 工具禁用尾注 (No-Tools Trailer)

> 注：追加在压缩提示词末尾的二次提醒。

```text
REMINDER: Do NOT call any tools. Respond with plain text only -- an <analysis> block followed by a <summary> block. Tool calls will be rejected and you will fail the task.
```

## 8. 提示词组装逻辑说明

### 全量压缩 (`getCompactPrompt`)

组装顺序：
1. `NO_TOOLS_PREAMBLE`（工具禁用前言）
2. `BASE_COMPACT_PROMPT`（全量压缩主体）
3. 如有自定义指令：`Additional Instructions:\n${customInstructions}`
4. `NO_TOOLS_TRAILER`（工具禁用尾注）

### 部分压缩 (`getPartialCompactPrompt`)

组装顺序：
1. `NO_TOOLS_PREAMBLE`（工具禁用前言）
2. `PARTIAL_COMPACT_PROMPT` 或 `PARTIAL_COMPACT_UP_TO_PROMPT`（根据方向选择）
3. 如有自定义指令：`Additional Instructions:\n${customInstructions}`
4. `NO_TOOLS_TRAILER`（工具禁用尾注）

### 摘要格式化 (`formatCompactSummary`)

后处理步骤：
1. 移除 `<analysis>...</analysis>` 区块（这是思维草稿，最终不需要）
2. 提取 `<summary>...</summary>` 内容，替换为 `Summary:\n` + 内容
3. 清理多余空行
